Making an extension from scratch can be a daunting task. Luckily, Spicetify provides a powerful API Wrapper that makes it easy to interact with Spotify's internal APIs as well as provide out-of-the-box methods to help you easily create extensions.

## Spicetify Object
You can access the Spicetify object by typing `Spicetify` in the DevTools console, inside your extension, or `window.top.Spicetify` if you're developing an app inside an `iframe`.

```ts
Spicetify
```

Navigate the sidebar to see all the methods and properties available in the Spicetify object!
