Greetings Spicetifiers! ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ¶

Our community has been growing a lot lately and some of the growing pains that we've had has been the information segmentation. This documentation website already tried to tackle that, as well as our Discord server. However, we've expanded through other projects other than the CLI, and, as such, we are ***happy*** to announce that **we are now officially a [Spicetify Organization](https://github.com/spicetify) on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰**

Essentially, this will not affect any of the inner workings of the community or Spicetify, but it will make it easier for you to get in touch with the community and to help us grow. ðŸ™Œ You can find all our projects under this new GitHub organization, and we will be adding more projects as we go along.

> We hope that Spicetify will continue to be a great tool for everyone, and we are looking forward to enhancing it with new features and improvements. ðŸ™Œ

Additionally, we've also created an Open Collective page for whoever has the means to and wants to financially help our community. For now, we do not know what will be the adhesion to this, therefore we don't have many plans on how to split these donations, however, helping to pay the domain already helps! What you can be sure of, is that everything will be decided by the community, and all decisions will be as transparent as possible.
