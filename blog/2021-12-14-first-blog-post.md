Greetings Spicetifiers! ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ¶

First and foremost, thank you all very much for your continued support of this project! The community that we have gathered on Discord over the past months has been amazing, and I would like to thank every single one of you that made this possible.

Let's get our hands dirty now. Over the last few months, we've had a few issues with Spotify and a few of their breaking changes. To add to the fire, during all of this turmoil, the _Spicetify Developer Community_ was weak, we had very little support outside of the theming community, and there was an overwhelming amount of duplicated issues on GitHub because of this.

Let's be honest, our wiki was not the most up-to-date, but at the same time, we also did not have the right tools to enable the community to contribute to it, as it was hosted as a GitHub integrated wiki. As such, we have decided to create this little documentation website that, we hope, will facilitate its maintainability and give power to the community in how they want the project to present itself to the world.

Hope you can join us in this journey and thank you for coming on the ride! ðŸš€
