# Spicetify Docs

This repository holds the documentation for Spicetify, which can be found [here](https://spicetify.app).

## Contributing

If you feel like you can contribute, please do so by opening an issue or pull request. We are always open to expand our documentation and add new features.

## Local Development

We are using yarn to manage our dependencies, as it is Docusaurus's default, as such, you may start by installing dependencies by running `yarn`.

```
$ yarn start
```

The command above starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
